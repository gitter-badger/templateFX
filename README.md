templateFX
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tferi/templateFX.svg?branch=master)]

Coming soon!

Laundry list:
  * Investigate more performant representation for managed attributes instead of swapping that poor immutable list.
  * Figure out how constrants should be set in the DSL for GridPane, Anchorpane, etc.
  * Write macro for autogenerating attribute types based on their name and the class they're bound to.
  * Possibly write macro for extracting attributes from any javafx class based on getters/setters.
  * Cleanup tests.
  * Set-once properties?
